# E-Library-tool
A tool to enable researchers find books, papers, journals among others easily

#Intro
As final year students we were tasked to come up with a project. With inspiration, we developed this tool
uploaded at a later time but for purposes of rememberance.

Attaced below are all the files needed, includes the concept paper, proposal, report and the notebook  from which this project was done

#How it works
This tool has a preset dataset of randomly generated books about computing in general; runs in jupyter notebooks written in python
one needs to have the Anaconda framework if they wish to add on the code on their local machines

This tool is based om the collaborative filtering algorithm and we belieave as the project grows more and more functionalty will be added to this tool

##PLEASE endeavor to read through the proposal and report for a complete understanding of this project and feel free to add, develop pick inspiration from this project
